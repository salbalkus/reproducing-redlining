# reproducing-redlining
An attempt to reproduce the figures in the FiveThirtyEight article "[The Lasting Legacy of Redlining](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redlining/)" originally authored by Ryan Best and Elena Mej√≠a. I use the data for the project from the [FiveThirtyEight GitHub repository](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/redlining) as well as the 2020 Census.
