# reproducing-redlining
An attempt to reproduce the figures in the FiveThirtyEight article "[The Lasting Legacy of Redlining](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redlining/)" originally authored by Ryan Best and Elena Mej√≠a. I use the data for the project from the [FiveThirtyEight GitHub repository](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/redlining) as well as the 2020 Census, accessed through the `tidycensus` package.

# Results
If you are simply interested in viewing my attempt at reproducing the figures from the article, they are located in `results/output.html`. To view them, simply download the `results/output.html` file and open in a browser (such as Chrome). You can also clone the repository and open the `results/output.html` file from there. The `result/output.html` is produced by knitting the `scripts/driver.Rmd` script. Interim steps are produced by code in the **R** folder. 

Please see below for more details on how the figures were reproduced and how to rerun the code and analysis.

# How to Run Code

There are twoways to reproduce the results here. They are as follows:

## Open and run individual code cells from the `scripts/driver.Rmd`

The `scripts/driver.Rmd` file runs each step of the simulation and saves the output to the **data** folder. To reproduce individual steps of the analysis, do the following:

1. Clone this Git repository to your local machine.
2. If necessary, install any packages listed under "Dependencies" below that you do not already have installed.
3. Open `scripts/driver.Rmd` in RStudio and run the desired cells corresponding to the steps of the analysis that you would like to reproduce.

Knitting `scripts/driver.Rmd` to an .html file will run the entire file and reproduce the results as a .html file.

## Run `scripts/driver.R`

The `scripts/driver.R` file should automatically knit the visualizations to html. To run this script, simply:

1. Clone this Git repository to your local machine.
2. If necessary, install any packages listed under "Dependencies" below that you do not already have installed or are not automatically installed by `pacman`.
3. Run `scripts/driver.R` either in RStudio or from the command line by navigating to the repository using `cd` and running `Rscript scripts/driver.R`

# Contents

- **data**: Stores data downloads and intermediate steps of the analysis. Note that due to file size sharing restrictions, I only include the first step of downloads. WARNING: Regenerating the data from scratch using *scripts/driver.R* may potentially take up to about 30 minutes to complete.
- **R**: Code to run each intermediate step of the analysis. These are implemented in the driver script.
- **scripts**: Stores the *driver.Rmd* RMarkdown script that reproduces the visualizations from the FiveThirtyEight article, as well as *driver.R* which automatically knits *driver.Rmd* when run from the command line.
- **results**: Contains the reproduced visualizations from the article in the form of a .html file.
- **environment**: Contains a Dockerfile and associated files in case users want to build a Docker image containing the necessary repositories.
